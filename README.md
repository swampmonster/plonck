# plonck

An attempt at making a planck-compatible pcb with bluetooth
![PCB Render](images/pcb-render.png)

## Current status:
This is very much a work in progress, no pcb's have yet to be manufactured.  
The pcb may or may not even fit in standard planck cases so having one made is discouraged until  
i've actually had some made for myself.
